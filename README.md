# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this school district analysis was to remove the grading discrepancy regarding Thomas High School ninth graders, and then re-calculate the following metrics:
1. A district summary
2. A school summary
3. The five highest and lowest performing schools
4. The average math and reading scores by grade (and by school)
5. The average scores by school spending
6. The average scores by school size
7. The average scores by school type (charter vs. district)

## Results

-**How is the district summary affected?**

As shown in the above picture, the changes were minimal:

-Average math score dropped from 79.0 to 78.9

-The percentage of students passing math dropped from 75% to 74.8%

-The percentage of students passing reading dropped from 86% to 85.7%

-The overall passing percentage dropped from 65% to 64.9%





### **How is the school summary affected?**

Changes were much more signicant at the school level:

-Average math score dropped from 83.41 to 83.35

-Average reading score increased from 83.85 to 83.90

-The percentage of students passing math dropped from 93.27% to 66.91%

-The percentage of students passing reading dropped from 97.31% to 69.66%

-The overall passing percentage dropped from 90.95% to 65.08%





### **How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?**

For this comparison, I'll compare Thomas High School to the average of the other schools (without THS included) for each metric:

-Average Math Score: The district average is 80.22, so THS is now closer at 83.35

-Average Reading Score: The district average is 82.43, so THS is now further away at 83.90

-% Passing Math: The district average is 80.11%, so THS is now below average at 66.91%

-% Passing Reading: The district average is 88.64%, so THS is now below average at 69.66%

-% Overall Passing: The district average is 72.01%, so THS is now below average at 65.08%
 
        



### **How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:**
            
-**Math and reading scores by grade**

-**Scores by school spending**

-**Scores by school size**

-**Scores by school type**

![Reading Scores by Grade](https://github.com/Nveatch/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/grade_reading_comparison.png)
![Scores by School Spending](https://github.com/Nveatch/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/school_spending_comparison.png)
![Scores by School Size](https://github.com/Nveatch/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/school_size_comparison.png)
![Scores by School Type](https://github.com/Nveatch/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/school_type_comparison.png)

Replacing the ninth-grade scores didn't have an overall impact on these metrics, as it was marginal enough to be lost in the overall rounding/formatting.
